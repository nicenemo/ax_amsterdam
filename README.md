This is an experimental Dutch accent demonstrating some of the new  features  of
this  version  and some special phoneme combinations to overcome the lack of the
proper Dutch: sch ,g s ui ui sounds in Narrator 37.7, The uu sound doesn't  work
properly  yet.  The  name  "Amsterdam"  is chosen to distinguish it from the the
coming enhanced dutch.accent also developed by me.  This  will  be  as  good  as
!USA.accent.

This accent is optimized for use with Narrator 37.7 and requires Translator43.

Improvements will be to the benefit of  everybody.  Distribution  only  permited
through AMINET or AMINET CD's!

I also included an older nederlands.accent (I'm already  working  on  it  for  a
while.)  which  is  a  bit  better but less organized, and it surly crashes your
machine sooner or later. It's easy to be seen How handy the  empty  matches  and
lhs-reference features Mr. Barlow implemented can be:

It's not easy to do speak things from right to left like some dutch numers  when
reading from left to right using version 2.


## Installation

Copy or move the [Amsterdam.accent](./Amsterdam.accent) file to the
`Locale:accents` directory; which should also be `SYS:Locale/accents`  directory 
or the `HD0:Locale/accents` directory.
   
There  is  also  a [Nederlands.accent](Nederllands.accent)  file  for  an  older
version of the translator library.
